# HoG-MNIST
 A personal re-implementation of the scikit-image hog() function for the calculation of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients of image for feature extraction.
 
 Applied on the MNIST dataset, but can be used for feature extraction of any image. 
 
 The feature vectors can be used as embeddings for model training
